## **Modules & Features**

### **1. DOM Manipulation**
**Purpose:** Dynamically manipulate HTML elements.  

**Features:**
- Add items to a list dynamically.
- Edit existing items by clicking and saving with Enter.
- Remove last item or clear the entire list.
- Toggle strike-through on items to mark as done.
- Item count displayed beside Clear button updates dynamically.

**How to Use:**  
Type in input → use buttons to add, remove, or clear → click items to toggle strike-through or edit.

### **2. Events**
**Purpose:** Learn JavaScript event handling.  

**Features:**
- Click events log “Clicked”.
- Hover events log “Mouse Enter” and “Mouse Leave”.
- Keyboard events log pressed keys when focused.
- Live event log maintains last 60 events.

**How to Use:**  
Hover/click the box or press keys → check the event log.

### **3. Algorithms**
**Purpose:** Practice basic algorithmic problems.  

**Features:**
- Reverse string.
- Check palindrome.
- Compute factorial.
- Array operations: sum, max, unique elements.
- Handles array input as `[1,2,3]` or `1,2,3`.

**How to Use:**  
Input value → select algorithm → click Run → see output.

### **4. Async / Fetch**
**Purpose:** Learn asynchronous JavaScript and Fetch API.  

**Features:**
- Fetch random user from `https://randomuser.me/api/`.
- Display results as formatted JSON.
- Shows “Loading...” during fetch.
- Error handling for network issues.

**How to Use:**  
Click **Get Random User** → JSON output displayed in the module.

### **5. Local Storage**
**Purpose:** Practice browser data storage.  

**Features:**
- Save, load, delete key-value pairs.
- Supports strings and JSON objects.
- Automatically parses JSON on load.

**How to Use:**  
Enter Key/Value → Save → Load → Delete → Output displayed dynamically.

### **6. Closures**
**Purpose:** Demonstrate closures in JavaScript.  

**Features:**
- Input numbers `x` and `y`.
- Calculates `outer(x) → inner(y)` and shows step-by-step execution.
- Displays inner function as code for learning purposes.

**How to Use:**  
Enter `x` and `y` → click Run → see the closure execution in output.

### **7. Prototype / OOP**
**Purpose:** Learn Object-Oriented Programming with constructors and inheritance.  

**Features:**
- **Person object:** Name & Age → methods: `greet()`, `birthday()`.
- **Student object:** Inherits Person, adds `ID` and `study()` method.
- Prototype chain visualization.
- Interactive buttons to create, show, and call methods.

**How to Use:**  
Fill Name/Age (and ID for Student) → use buttons to interact with objects → observe prototype chain and outputs.
